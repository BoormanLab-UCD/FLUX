EEG cap montage

1. Ask participants to arrive with their hair washed, without using any conditioner.
2. Measure the participant&#39;s head circumference and choose the cap of the correct size. Sizes available: small (46-52), medium (52-58), large (58-64).
3. Put the cap on the participant, making sure the Cz electrode position is centered/halfway between the Nasion and Inion.
4. Make sure the cap is left-right symmetric and then close the chin strap.
  - The cap is fitted on the participant correctly when Fp1/Fp2 - O1/O2 - T7/T8, viewed from the side, are all in the same plane (with Fp1/Fp2 close to the eyebrows).
5. Push aside the hair in the electrode opening until the skin is clearly visible.
6. Apply electrode gel through each electrode opening, using a syringe and a blunt needle.
  - Make sure the adjacent electrodes do not bridge together.

Check impedance of EEG/EOG/ECG electrodes

1. Connect the impedance meter to the EEG cap.
2. Cycle through all your electrodes and make sure the impedance is below 10kOhm.
  - For electrodes having higher impedances than 10kOhm, scrape the skinin the electrode openingby gently twirling a cotton bud.

Attach HPI coils

Attach HPI coils on the forehead  and behind the ears (on top of the EEG cap) as shown in Figure 2.

The coils must be covered by the MEG helmet/sensor array, so place them as high on the head as possible.

1. Tape the yellow coil to the participant. This one will not be used or digitized.
2. Have the participant carefully put on the _Polhemus_ goggles.

Coil Numbers

1. Blue
 2. White
 3. Red
 4. Black
 5. Yellow

Digitize head-coordinate system

1. Turn on the _Polhemus_ system (button on the back).
2. Make sure the Transmitter is on the chair with the cable pointing down.
3. Select digitization on the acquisition panel.
4. Click on _Coordinate frame alignment_ in the Acquisition software.
5. Remove the cap of the pen.
6. Rest the tip of the pen on the nasion and pre-auricular points (see green crosses in Figure 2) and press the button on the pen. Repeat for all fiducial points.
  - It is recommended to digitize the head frame from left to right to avoid any confusions during the MEG data acquisition.
  - Make sure the pen is perpendicular to the head.
7. Stop the digitization after the third point (right pre-auricle) by holding the pen 30cm away from the receivers and clicking once. You should hear two beeps.
8. Check if the measured location of the pre-auricular points are aligned (x-values must not be more than 5mm displaced).
9. If necessary, redo measurements by clicking Coordinate frame alignment again and repeat the procedure.

Digitize HPI coils

1. Click on _HPI coils_ in the Acquisition software.
2. Rest the tip of the pen gently on little hole in the middle of the coils and press the button on the pen. Repeat for all coils.
  - It is recommended to digitize the HPI coils from left to right to avoid any confusions during the MEG data acquisition.
3. Stop the digitization after the fourth coil (_if only using 4 coils_) by holding the pen 30cm away from the receivers and clicking once. You should hear two beeps.
4. Check if the measured location of the HPI coils are aligned (coordinated values must not be more than 5mm displaced).
5. If necessary, redo measurement by clicking HPI coils again and repeat the procedure.

Digitize EEG electrodes

1. Click on _EEG electrode_ in the Acquisition software_._
2. Rest the tip of the pen gently on the ring around each EEG electrode and press the button on the pen. Repeat for all electrodes, starting from the reference.
  - EEG electrodes should be digitized in the order provided by the MEG system.
3. Stop the digitization after the 64th electrodes by holding the pen 30cm away from the receivers and clicking once. You should hear two beeps.
4. If any EEG electrode is not digitized properly, the procedure can be redone only for that electrode.

Digitize head shape

1. Click on _Pen_ on the bottom right.
2. Put the pen&#39;s cap back and gently stroke the point of the pen over several (especially bony) shapes of the head: eyebrows, nose, and along the skull, while pressing the button of the pen.
3. Stop when the head shape is recognizable using the digitized points by holding the pen 30cm away from the receiver and click once. You should hear two beeps.

Prepare the participant in the MSR

1. Before bringing the participant to the MSR, ask them to hold the cables (EOG/ECG electrodes, EEG and HPI cables).
2. When the participant is seated, connect the sensors on the gantry to the electrodes on the participant (REF and GND to their corresponding sensors, far left column vEOG, second columns hEOG and third column ECG).
3. Attach HPI coils into the red plug at the left panel of the gantry.
4. Attach EEG cables into the yellow and green plugs at the left panel of the gantry.
5. Lift the participant into helmet, using the foot pedal, until the top of the head touches the helmet. Ask the participant to seat comfortably and lift higher if necessary.
6. Measure the distance of the participant&#39;s nasion to the screen and FO Camera Head/IR Illuminator.
7. Check communication using intercom.
8. Position Eyelink camera in front of the participant. Make sure it is pointing the eyes.
9. Adjust the camera lens focus. You should be able to see the participant&#39;s eyelashes.
10. On the EyeLink PC, click on each eye and then click auto-threshold. If necessary, adjust pupil size and corneal reflex thresholds manually.
11. Make sure the EyeLink computer is NOT in &quot;calibration mode&quot; when starting the experiment.
