%% Introduction
% 
%% Why the FLUX pipeline?
% The aim of the FLUX pipeline is to provide a set of standards, implemented 
% as a tutorial for using some of most common toolboxes to analyze full MEG datasets. 
% The pipeline will be used for education and will provide a common framework 
% for MEG data analysis.
% 
% This section will focus on the Matlab toolbox <https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/ 
% Fieldtrip>. The core arguments for using Fieldtrip are:
%% 
% * The Fieldtrip toolbox is supported by an active and dynamic group of developers 
% ensuring that the latest analysis tools are available.
% * The toolbox and pipeline are Open Source and henceforth compatible with 
% Open Science approaches.
% * The Fieldtrip toolbox is part of the Matlab environment allowing for the 
% use of a wide-range of toolboxes with advanced features and so customizing signal 
% processing and analysis even further.
%% Target users
% The target users are researchers new to Fieldtrip as well as more advanced 
% users seeking to standardize their analyses. The FLUX pipeline is particularly 
% geared towards cognitive neuroscientist with an interest in task-based paradigms. 
% The developers of the pipeline are cognitve neuroscientists with a strong interest 
% in brain oscillations and source localization.
%% Using the pipeline in self-studies and education
% The Fieldtrip toolbox has an excellent selection of <https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/tutorial/ 
% Tutorials> and <https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/example/ Examples>. Nevertheless, 
% the options are so many that the learning curve for new users is very steep. 
% The FLUX pipeline provides a set of procedures for what we consider best practice 
% at this moment in time. Consistent with an Open Science approach, the FLUX pipeline 
% provides a validated and documented approach for MEG data analysis. Each analysis 
% step comes with explanations and illustrations. Furthermore, questions are embedded 
% in the tutorials which will be useful for self-study or they can be used in 
% educational settings.
% 
% 
% 
% We will not link back to sections on the Fieldtrip webpage as they will change 
% over time; nevertheless, users are are strongly encouraged to consult the website 
% as they develop their skills and insight.
% 
% 
% 
% To use the FLUX toolbox the following installations and downloads are required:
%% 
% # Recent version of Matlab (MathWorks Inc) installed including the following 
% toolboxes:
%% 
% * Image Processing Toolbox
% * Signal Processing Toolbox
% * Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
%% 
% The Fieldtrip website provides detailed discussion on these <https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/faq/requirements/ 
% requirements>.
% 
% 
% 
% 2. <https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/download/ Download> the Fieldtrip toolbox.
% 
% 3. <https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/faq/should_i_add_fieldtrip_with_all_subdirectories_to_my_matlab_path/ 
% Set the Fieldtrip paths> in Matlab.
%% Preregistration and publication
% Publication, example:
% 
% "The data were analyzed using the Matlab toolbox Fieldtrip v20220113 (Oostenveld 
% et al., 2011) following the standards defined in the FLUX Pipeline (Ferrante 
% et al., 2022)"
